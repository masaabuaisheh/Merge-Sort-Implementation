The provided code implements the Merge Sort algorithm in C++ using vectors. Merge Sort is a popular sorting algorithm known for its efficiency and stability. It follows the Divide and Conquer strategy by dividing the array into smaller subarrays, sorting them individually, and then merging them back together in a sorted manner.
